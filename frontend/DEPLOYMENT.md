# Build
npm install
npm run build

# Deploy
# Serve `dist/` at your main domain (e.g., https://lotterybig.com)
# Ensure the API base is configured:
# - Set VITE_API_BASE at build time
# - Or provide a .env with VITE_API_BASE before build

# Example (Windows PowerShell)
# $env:VITE_API_BASE="https://api.lotterybig.com"
# npm run build
